        Hi! I'm Irfan Zuhdi bin Noor Hisham. I'm 16 and I live at Kelantan, Malaysia. I'm still studying at Maahad Sains Tok Guru ( MSTG ) at Pengkalan Chepa, Kelantan. I'm still in secondary school and I love coding. Every school holidays, I will learn coding and make projects to exercise</p>
      <p>
        I started with Scratch that I've knew from my teacher in Asas Sains Komputer ( ASK ) subject. I love making projects and games with Scratch because I can make it easily. But then I started to use other programming languages like Python, html, css and javascript. I started with Python because I've learned it in my school. After that, I started learning to make websites with html, css and javascript because it's easy and many programmers started with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned to make websites mostly from SuperSimpleDev YouTube channel. The way he explained is very easy to understand for beginners like me and I recommended that channel. He has made a complete html, css, and javascript course with many exercises that can help you to master it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is just a practice for me to learn coding and also to learn english. It's also to connect all my projects. You can check them in the portfolio section. I think that's all from me. Thank you for reading.
